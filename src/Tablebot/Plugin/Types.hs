Stability   : experimental
Portability : POSIX

All of the important types used throughout the implementation. Defines plugins,
which are made out of features. Also defines how to construct and combine
plugins, and the @DatabaseDiscord@ monad transformer stack for allowing
database and Discord operations within your features.

-- * DatabaseDiscord
-- | The monad transformer stack used to represent computations that work with
-- the database and Discord. The top layer is for Persistent/Esqueleto database
-- operations - the main event handler is run through @runSqlPool@ to leave us
-- with a 'DiscordHandler' for our Discord operations.
--
-- "Tablebot.Plugin.Discord" provides some helper functions for
-- running Discord operations without excessive use of @lift@.
type DatabaseDiscord = SqlPersistT DiscordHandler

-- * Parser
-- | A simple definition for parsers on Text.
type Parser = Parsec Void Text

-- * Features
-- Bot functionality is split into /features/, which are combined into plugins.
-- Each feature is its own type, and the features are combined via records into
-- full plugins.

-- | For when you get a 'MessageCreate'. Checks that the @name@ is directly
-- after the bot prefix, and then runs @commandParser@ on it.
data Command = Command {
    -- | The name of the command.
    name :: Text,
    -- | A parser to run on the command arguments, returning a computation to
    -- run in 'DatabaseDiscord'.
    commandParser :: Parser (Message -> DatabaseDiscord ())
}

data SmartArgs = IntArg | StringArg | BoolArg
data ArgSpec = SmartArgs :/: ArgSpec | Rest | End | Multiple SmartArgs
infixr 5 :/:

data SmartValue = SInt Int | SStr String | SBool Bool

data SmartCommand = SmartCommand {
    smartName :: Text,
    smartEffect :: [SmartValue] -> Message -> DatabaseDiscord (),
    smartSubcommands :: [SmartCommand],
    smartArgs :: ArgSpec
}

-- | For when you get a 'MessageCreate', but instead of wanting to match on
-- "!name args" (for prefix "!"), you want a more general match. Useful for
-- commands that work with brackets or look for keywords.
newtype InlineCommand = InlineCommand {
    -- | The parser to run on every message (non-bot) received.
    inlineCommandParser :: Parser (Message -> DatabaseDiscord ())
}

-- | How to handle any messages changing. Called on Discord's 'MessageUpdate',
-- 'MessageDelete' and 'MessageDeleteBulk'. Useful for admin bots such as the
-- ub3rbot ub3rlog functionality.
newtype MessageChange = MessageChange {
    -- | A function to call on every message update. The first argument is
    -- whether the message was updated (True) or deleted (False).
    -- Will be run once per message if bulk deletion occurs.
    onMessageChange :: Bool -> ChannelId -> MessageId -> DatabaseDiscord ()
}

-- | Handles added reactions, which is useful for reaction-based functionality
-- (e.g. a quote bot that quotes messages reacted to with a certain emoji).
-- Tied to 'MessageReactionAdd' from Discord.
newtype ReactionAdd = ReactionAdd {
    -- | A function to call on every reaction add, which takes in details of
    -- that reaction ('ReactionInfo').
    onReactionAdd :: ReactionInfo -> DatabaseDiscord ()
}

-- | Handles removed reactions, which is useful in the same way as adding
-- reactions. Called on 'MessageReactionRemove'.
newtype ReactionDel = ReactionDel {
    -- | A function to call on every individual reaction delete, which takes in
    -- details of that reaction ('ReactionInfo').
    onReactionDelete :: ReactionInfo -> DatabaseDiscord ()
}

-- | Handles events not covered by the other kinds of features. This is only
-- relevant to specific admin functionality, such as the deletion of channels.
newtype Other = Other {
    -- | A function to call on every other event, which takes in details of
    -- that event.
    onOtherEvent :: Event -> DatabaseDiscord ()
}

-- | A feature for cron jobs - events which are run every @timeframe@
-- microseconds, regardless of any other interaction with the bot. Useful for
-- things like reminders.
--
-- Note that the loop starts with calling @onCron@ and /then/ delaying, so they
-- will all be invoked on bot start.
data CronJob = CronJob {
    -- | Delay between each call of @onCron@, in microseconds.
    timeframe :: Int,
    -- | Computation to do with each invocation of this cron job.
    onCron :: DatabaseDiscord ()
}

-- | A feature for generating help text
-- Each help text page consists of a explanation body, as well as a list of sub-pages
-- that display the short text for its page
data HelpPage = HelpPage {
    -- | The [sub]command name
    helpName :: Text,
    -- | The text to show when listed in a subpage list. Will be prefixed by its helpName
    helpShortText :: Text,
    -- | The text to show when specifically listed. Appears above the list of subpages
    helpBody :: Text,
    -- | A list of help pages that can be recursively accessed
    helpSubpages :: [HelpPage]
} deriving Show

-- * Plugins
-- Plugins are groups of features that forms some functionality of your bot.
-- For example, you could have a Reminder bot (see
-- "Tablebot.Plugins.Reminder") that has a command for issuing
-- reminders, a cron job for doing them and then a migration that works with
-- the database.

-- | A plugin. Directly constructing these should be avoided (hence why it is
-- not exported by "Tablebot.Plugin") as this structure could change.

    onMessageChanges :: [MessageChange],

    otherEvents :: [Other],
    cronJobs :: [CronJob],
    helpPages :: [HelpPage],
    -- | A list of database migrations generated by Persistance.
    migrations :: [Migration]
}

-- | The empty plugin. This is the recommended method for constructing plugins
-- - use record update syntax with this rather than using @Pl@ directly.
--
-- Examples of this in use can be found in the imports of
-- "Tablebot.Plugins".

-- | Combines a list of plugins into a single plugin with the combined
-- functionality. The bot actually runs a single plugin, which is just the
